<h1 align="center">HISTORY OF THE JEAN JACKET</h1>

<p align="center">"The first denim jacket was created circa 1880 by denim legend and Levi's founder Levi
  Strauss. Strauss is credited with designing the first-ever jeans in 1870 as a durable,
  breathable utility garment for cowboys, railroad engineers, and miners to wear during the
  gold rush out West. Soon after the runaway success of jeans, he gave the world a top to
  match and dubbed it the Triple Pleat Blouse."
</p>

<p align="center">"We spoke with Tracey Panek, a historian at Levi Strauss & Co., who said
  that the denim jackets were ideal for laborers. "Our denim jacket was incredibly durable
  for various types of manual labor," Panek said. "The horizontal seams holding down the
  pleats could be removed to give the wearer extra room."
</p>

<p align="center">"While the Levi's denim jacket has evolved since then, the functionality
   and innate coolness of the piece has earned it the status as an all-American rebel's
   outerwear of choice. "By the '50s, wearing denim was often associated with juvenile
   delinquency," Panek said. "Jeans were even banned in some schools, and denim became the
   nonconformists' uniform of choice." From James Dean's iconic denim-jacket clad character
   in Rebel Without a Cause in the '50s to Rihanna's deconstructed versions today, jean
   jackets buck convention, express individuality, and epitomize anti-establishment cool."
